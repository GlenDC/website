In deze tijden zagen verschillende problemen het dagtlight. Wereldwijde problemen zoals COVID-19 lagen aan de oorzaak. Dankzij de toegankelijkheid van media, waren ieder van ons in staat om ons te informeren over een betere manier om met deze problimatiek om te gaan. In ons verloop om ons aan te passen aan de nieuwe veiligheidsnormen, economische veranderingen en meer, hebben we onze focus in de laatste jaren verlegt naar gezonheid, persoonlijke ontwikkeling, de wereld binnen in ons. Velen van ons hebben ook spiritualiteit (her)ontdekt. Deze en vele andere menieren hielpen ons de voorbije navigeren tot het beste van onze vermogen.

De positieve kant aan deze moeilijke tijden is dat we een nieuwe opportuniteit hebben gevonden om te herfocussen en herevalueren van wat echt belangrijk is voor ons, hier en nu. Alsook wat we kunnen doen voor een betere, gezondere en een rijkgevuld leven dat we allen kunnen kiezen om te hebben.

Among those subjects the working and practicing on raising our awareness of our emotional world and gaining the capacity to choose what emotions we want to feel, besides managing it in a way that support us, turned into a strong baseline to reach goals, to create better habits or to have inner peace, and this even could give us the space to appreciate what we already have, and see our work in progress to what we can be.

The awareness and strength of our emotional and psychological world is a key component to successed challenging and painful situations, with a learner mindset, to get back on our feet, to get stronger, hopeful and grateful.

Parenting is an aspect of our lives we are learning to shape it, and the question arises: **what kind of parent do I want to be?** Best answer I have found is: I want to be my most honest self on my parenting style, I want to offer connection because I know how to connect with myself. And the most honest answer: Therefore I am parent on the making, on the day by day decisions I make, and who I choose to be everyday. Because I can choose to express my inner authentic truth, which would mean I can bring out my most authentic contribution to others. Specially the ones most closed to me.

Having the above in mind. I would like to offer you this list of resources, that I can recommend you to check it out, either in books or on internet.
