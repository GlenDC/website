# H1 Parenting Tools References

In the current times, several issues have surfaced due the circumstances generated by worldwide problems such as COVID-19, and with the accessibility to media, allowed as to keep ourselves inform about better ways to deal with the challenges we had to faced. In our process to adapt to security polities, economical changes, and more in the last years, our focus went more and more towards health, personal growth, the inner world, spirituality, and many other answers we have been pursuing to navigate the past years as best as we could.

The positive side of those challenging times is that we have got a new opportunity to re-focus and re-evaluate what really matters to us, in our present moment, and what changes we could make for a better, healthier, fulfill life that all of us can choose to have.

Among those subjects the working and practicing on raising our awareness of our emotional world and gaining the capacity to choose what emotions we want to feel, and managing it in a way that support us, turned into a strong baseline to reach a goal, to create better habits or to have inner peace, and could give us the space to appreciate what we already have, and see our work in progress to what we can be.

The awareness and strength of our emotional and psychological world is one key component to successed challenging and painful situations with a learner mindset, to get back on our feet, to get stronger, hopeful and grateful.

Parenting is an aspect of our lives we are learning to shape it, and the question arises: what kind of parent do I want to be? Best answer I have found is: I want to be my most honest self on my parenting style, I want to offer connection because I know how to connect with myself. And the most honest answer: Therefore I am parent on the making, on the day by day decisions I make, and who I choose to be everyday. Because I can choose to express my inner authentic truth, cause that would mean I can bring out my most authentic contribution to others. Specially the ones most closed to me.

Having above in mind. I would like to offer you this list of resources recommended to check it out, either in books or on internet. Please, feel free to take from them what you need to, or adapt them to your needs, because we all have different main topics to focus on first.
