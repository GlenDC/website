{{< param "name.plabayo" >}} was co-founded in 2021 by [{{< param "name.eliza" >}}]({{< param "navigation.eliza" >}}) and [{{< param "name.glen" >}}]({{< param "navigation.glen" >}}. Our applications and games are the product, not you the user. All data is yours and yours alone to keep. Privacy and transparency is at core of our mission. The "Free" in "Free and Open Source Software" (FOSS) is about freedom and helps maintain the civil liberal rights. It doesn't not mean that all our products are gratis.

Our slogan is "Play, Work and Grow", one we take as serious as it is playful. Children learn by doing, but it is no different for adults. Helping you in your life long journey of learning is at the core of our mission. Thank you for trusting us and for using our products.
